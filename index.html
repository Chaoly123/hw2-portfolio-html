        <h2 class="head">About ME</h2>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
            <p>Well I was born and raised in Minnesota, Saint Paul. I live here all of my life, I lived in the same
                house for the past 28 years. With a few modern fixer upper except for central air, which is a must
                have to have in Minnesota. I graduate from Mahtomedi High School 2007, I graduate from Minneapolis
                Community Technical College(MCTC) with a certificate in Central Sterilization. After graduating, I
                work at Saint John Hospital. The computers' system wasn't not excuting the right application to
                Sterile the instrument. Informing the "IT" support. They would reinstall or reprogram the app.
                After watching and learning the steps of how to reinstall the application, I pick up the steps of
                how to re-initiate the app. If I can learn how to reinstall the app, I can increase my knowledge in
                in IT field.</p>
            <p><strong>Hobbies</strong></p>
            <p>1. Travel
            <p> Just this past May 2021, I came back from Florida. There was more water activies
                to do down there than here. Beside trying to finding a crytral clear lake or river is hard
                enough up here than down there.</p>
            <p>2. Food.
            <p> I love to watch and learn from Youtube channels from "Binging with Babish",
                "Outdoor Chef Life", "Sam the Cooking Guy". I also watch Youtube Bloggers who travel
                around the world to eat, who are introduce into a new cultures and races that they didn't
                know at the time. </p>
            <p>3. Outdoor activies.
            <p>I like to snowboard during the winter times so I won't have to hibernate during the cold nights. I
                love to pontooning with some friends during summer time. Enjoying the water and water ski. Garden,
                I just started this year gardening. I planted cherry tomatoes, birds eye pepper, thai chilli pepper,
                cilantro, green onions, cucumber, garlic, greens beans, and cherries.</p>
